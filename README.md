# Image_compression

This project was done as a part of the course GNR652 : Machine Learning in Remote Sensing. Image compression is implemented using K-means clustering. The aim is to compress a JPG/PNG image without loss of major attributes. We try to bolster this statement by running an CNN based image classification program. We use the Dogs vs. Cats dataset available on Kaggle.
